 * @brief Scenario
Write a program that counts the metrics of a file:

Number of all characters
Number of whitespaces
Number of lines
Number of all lower-case letters
You can (for now, to simplify your task, of course) assume constant file names. 
To speed up your programming, you can test your program on its source code. 
First, open a file in read mode. After that, character by character, read the 
file and count the numbers asked. Remember to close the file.

Note: in a real program, it's important to check whether all the files needed
 actually exist and that you can read their contents. In our program, you should 
 at least check that the files have been successfully opened.

If the fopen function fails, then print the message Error opening file. and end the
 program. There's only one instance of output from your program - your output can 
 vary, depending on the file contents.

Expected output
Lines: 34
Whitespaces: 153
Characters: 686
Small letter: a : 23
Small letter: b : 1
Small letter: c : 25
Small letter: d : 7
Small letter: e : 27
Small letter: f : 13
Small letter: g : 1
Small letter: h : 12
Small letter: i : 32
Small letter: j : 0
Small letter: k : 1
Small letter: l : 14
Small letter: m : 6
Small letter: n : 36
Small letter: o : 16
Small letter: p : 9
Small letter: q : 0
Small letter: r : 20
Small letter: s : 23
Small letter: t : 39
Small letter: u : 14
Small letter: v : 0
Small letter: w : 4
Small letter: x : 0
Small letter: y : 0
Small letter: z : 3
